## Warning: Library Under Active Development

Please be aware that this library is currently under active development. As such, it is subject to frequent updates and changes. While we strive to ensure stability and reliability, its rapid evolution means that certain features or behaviors may change without prior notice. We encourage users to stay updated with the latest version, but also advise caution and thorough testing before using this library in production environments.

## Quick Install

Install Bunkoer with pip:

```bash
pip install bunkoer
```
### OpenAI API Key Required

To run the Bunkoer library, an OpenAI API key is necessary. You must obtain this key and export it in your environment variables. Set up the key as follows:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key. Without this key, the library will not function properly.

## ‚öôÔ∏è What is Bunkoer?

Bunkoer is a framework designed to secure the development of applications powered by large language models. It offers solutions that:

- **Ensure Privacy**: Bunkoer integrates AI models with mechanisms to safeguard sensitive information, employing anonymization techniques and privacy-preserving prompts.
- **Foster Ethical AI**: The framework leans on AI models to uphold ethical standards, evaluating and modifying responses to maintain privacy and determining appropriate data handling actions.

## How Does Bunkoer Help?

Bunkoer's core strengths include:

- **Modular Features**: Tailored tools and integrations for enhancing data privacy in AI models, designed to be both modular and user-friendly.
- **Pre-configured Anonymization Processes**: Ready-made combinations of features aimed at achieving higher-level privacy tasks.

## How to Use Bunkoer?

### Secure Your Files

Using Bunkoer's security feature, you can anonymize any type of file. Currently, this feature is available for CSV files.

Example in Python:

```python
# Import the security module of Bunkoer
from bunkoer.security import SecureFile 

file_path = "/path/to/your/file.csv"  # Specify the file you want to secure
secured_file = SecureFile(file_path)  # SecureFile function returns the path of the anonymized file
```

[Warning] The Bunkoer library is still under development and testing. Sometimes, the anonymization process may be incorrect. We are not responsible if your data is exposed inadvertently.

### Use Case:

Once your data is secured, you can use it for various purposes. For example, you can process your anonymized data with ChatGPT. To do this, you can use our repository [bunkoer x streamlit](https://github.com/Bunkoer/bunkoer-x-streamlit).

### Coming Soon:

- Support for file types: JSON, SQL
- Streamlined anonymization API

### Optimize Your Anonymized File

- Coming soon
